    "Now that you have established a working understanding of qubits, you will see below how to use them with quantum gates in simple circuits of one to two qubits. Later on, we can tackle more complicated circuits, but for now we just need a basic knowledge of how to read a quantum circuit and how to follow the qubits through the actions performed on them by the quantum gates. Being able to quickly read a quantum circuit is a wonderful skill to have and will be highly beneficial if you go on to read state of the art quantum computing research articles, where circuits can get very complex *very* rapidly."
