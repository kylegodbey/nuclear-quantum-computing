# Quantum computing: a brief introduction 

Author: Alexandra Semposki

To fully grasp the following chapters of this Jupyter Book, a brief---but firm---foundation in quantum computation should first be established. In order to do this quickly and efficiently, this chapter is dedicated to the construction of this foundation in the reader's mind. These sections are drawn heavily from multiple sources listed below, which we recommend the reader to if you find the material here lacking in any way, or if you would like to dig deeper into any of these subjects. 

We begin on the next page with a comparison between classical and quantum bits, and continue to discuss some of the quantum mechanics and mathematics of these so-called "qubits", as well as some introductory circuitry.
