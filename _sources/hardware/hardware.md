# Running on "Hardware"

TODO: Expand this. This section covers running on hardware, both real and simulated. We also explore error mitigation techniques.

In the last chapter, we extensively discussed the VQE method and showed its results on a simulator. However, we did not explain much about that simulator---what is a quantum simulator in comparison to a real quantum computer? What differences arise between the two, and what issues can one run into using the two devices?
